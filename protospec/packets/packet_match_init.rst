Purpose
-------

This packet signals the client to initialize its datastructures for a new match.
Usually, this packet will only be sent if the player is in the queue, but it may also
be sent at any other time.

Structure
---------

Note that all examples shown here contain placeholder data and will have different content in actual packets.::

   {
      "uuid":"443b47701bfc44c3a38a22e943c087f5",

      "players_a": ["1a0ab7f4322542ea9d62052c874e25e7", ...],
      "players_b": ["7082a2f1f09a4a4fa264281628db179a", ...],

      "mode": "classic",
   }

``uuid`` is the UUID of the match. It is generated by the server and shared by all clients.

``players_a`` and ``players_b`` are lists containing the UUIDs of all players part of the match.
The two lists represent the two different factions.

``mode`` is the game mode this match is in. Currently, only ``classic`` is supported.
